**Date:** October 17, 2025 to October 26, 2025
**AI Tool Used:** ChatGPT (GPT-5)

**What was asked or generated:**
Guidance and code snippets were requested for implementing:

1. **Cloudinary** integration for image upload
2. **Firebase** integration for data storage and retrieval
3. **Geolocator** usage for adding location tagging functionality

**How it was applied:**
The generated code and instructions were used in the Flutter project to:

* Upload images securely to **Cloudinary** and store image URLs.
* Store and retrieve user data, including image URLs and metadata, from **Firebase Firestore**.
* Capture the user’s current coordinates using **Geolocator** and attach location tags to uploaded entries.

**Reflection on what was learned:**
Learned how to combine multiple cloud services effectively — using Cloudinary for media hosting, Firebase for structured data management, and Geolocator for location tagging — to create a more dynamic and interactive app experience.
